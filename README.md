# Console-Finances

## Description

Using Javascript and the dataset given, calculate each of the following:
<li>The total number of months included in the dataset.

<li>The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

<li>The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

<li>The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

<li>The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

I found this challenge the most difficult yet. Especially when it came to finding the average of changes. However, through research and the help of others, I managed to finally solve the challenge.

## Usage
