# Console-Finances

## Description

Using Javascript and the dataset given, calculate each of the following:
<li>The total number of months included in the dataset.

<li>The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

<li>The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

<li>The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

<li>The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

I found this challenge the most difficult yet. Especially when it came to finding the average of changes. However, through research and the help of others, I managed to finally solve the challenge.

This challenge also gave me insight about arrays, using .push, finding the minimum and maximum figure in arrays, as well as how to round numbers to 2 decimal places. Although JavaScript is a huge challenge at the moment, I believe there is still a lot to learn and a lot to research into.

## Usage

This is a current screenshot of the console log with the calculated data.
